        longDescription: "SCA-SHIELD is a Cloud Security research tool developed during MTech that detects cache and timing side-channel attacks in real-time. It leverages variations in CPU performance counters (via Intel PCM) during attacks like Flush+Reload, Prime+Probe, Spectre, and Meltdown. Using decision trees for feature filtering and SVMs for classification, the system achieves over 94.7% detection accuracy. The tool introduces novel detection metrics and is tested across both virtualized and bare-metal environments. Built on Ubuntu 20.04, it integrates low-level C++ modules for counter access and Python for machine learning pipelines. The framework addresses key issues like low detection accuracy, high latency, and poor threat modeling in existing solutions.",
